Great! Here's a **structured, day-wise delivery plan** to build your **basic student-tutor request & chat webapp** in **7 days**. This plan assumes you're working solo or with a small team and are comfortable with React, Node.js, and Firebase/Prisma.

---

## ✅ **Day-Wise Development Plan**

### 🔹 **Day 1: Project Setup & Authentication**

**Goals**:

* Set up frontend (Next.js + TailwindCSS)
* Set up backend (Node.js/Express or Next.js API)
* Set up database (Supabase)
* Set up authentication (Clerk or Supabase)

**Tasks**:

* Initialize frontend and backend repos ✅
* Design basic layout: landing page, login/signup 
* Integrate authentication (Google + email/password)
* Create users table in DB with role (student/tutor)

---

### 🔹 **Day 2: Student - Create & View Requests**

**Goals**:

* Build "Create Request" form
* Display student's own requests

**Tasks**:

* Create `Request` model in DB (title, desc, tags, category, etc.)
* Form validation + submit to API
* Show posted requests in dashboard
* Add "Mark as Solved" feature

---

### 🔹 **Day 3: Tutor - Browse Requests & Express Interest**

**Goals**:

* Display public list of requests
* Tutor can view and choose to chat

**Tasks**:

* Tutor dashboard: filter/search requests
* Add “Start Chat” button on each request
* Create `ChatRoom` model in DB (request\_id, student\_id, tutor\_id)

---

### 🔹 **Day 4: Chat System (Real-time)**

**Goals**:

* Implement real-time chat between student and tutor

**Tasks**:

* Use **Firebase Realtime DB or Firestore**
* Auto-create chatroom on tutor’s first message
* Chat UI (basic bubbles, timestamps)
* Store and sync messages

---

### 🔹 **Day 5: UI Polish & Role Separation**

**Goals**:

* Clean UI & navigation for both roles
* Proper redirection post-login (student/tutor)

**Tasks**:

* Role-based routing (e.g., `/student/*`, `/tutor/*`)
* Sidebar navigation for both roles
* Show status of requests (e.g., "In Chat", "Solved")

---

### 🔹 **Day 6: Admin Panel & Moderation (Optional MVP)**

**Goals**:

* Create basic admin access (hardcoded)
* Moderate or delete inappropriate content

**Tasks**:

* View all users & requests
* Ban user, delete requests
* Add report button to requests or chat

---

### 🔹 **Day 7: Testing, Bug Fixes & Deployment**

**Goals**:

* Final QA & polish
* Deploy to production

**Tasks**:

* Test flows (auth, request creation, chat)
* Fix edge cases (double request, no chatroom, etc.)
* Deploy frontend to **Vercel**, backend to **Render/Railway**
* Set up database on **Supabase/NeonDB/Railway**

  // useEffect : Hook : helps you to do side effects in your components
  // side effects are things like fetching data, subscribing to events, or manually changing the DOM
  // null, [], [state, state1]
  // null: runs only when the component mounts
  // []: runs only once when the component mounts, not on updates
  // [state]: runs when the component mounts and whenever the specified state changes
